At Carbon Direct, we review a lot of carbon offset projects.
Our goal is to meaningfully reduce the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere.
In order to do this, we support companies and individuals buying carbon
offsets from vetted projects.  These offset projects have attributes such 
as name, description, location, and type.  They also have inventories 
of offsets.  For example, a Direct Air Capture plant in Iceland might 
remove 100 tonnes at $50 in 2022, but 150 tonnes at $40 in 2023.  
We've gained access to this offset inventory and are building a product 
to let companies buy it.

For this interview, we will be build an API to let customers buy offsets
from offset projects.
